## netlify-rust-functions

Example of setting up a Rust workspace to build out lambda functions using Rust on Netlify.

**Attribution: Inspired and cloned from [Chris Biscardi][chrisbiscardi]'s example. Make sure to [checkout his rust courses on egghead.io][eggheadrust] and drop a follow on [twitter][christwitter]**. I've been inspired to learn rust due to Chris's enthusiasm about the programming language.

**Note:** I'm using WSL on windows with Linux, so my system is using a compatible target. If you are using MacOS, you'll want to review the `.cargo/config` setup for cross-musl in Chris's repository. This setup hasn't been tested on rust for Windows, so compatability is unknown.
